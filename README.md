# WordExpress Components
This package contains useful components for [WordExpress](http://wordexpress.io). The components contain GraphQL queries that return data from a WordPress database, using [ApolloStack](http://apollostack.com) to fetch the data.

For a full example of how these components work, check out the repo for [WordExpress.io](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordpressExpress), which was built using some of these components.
